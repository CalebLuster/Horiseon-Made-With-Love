This Page consists of a index.html file, stlye.css file, and a image folder.

TROUBLESHOOTING

- index.html
  - If you have troubles with the text not showing up or headings not appearing make sure to check the bottom left corner to trouble shoot any issues that you may have in your code. You mat simply need to save the file or refresh the file.
- style.css
  - If texts are not correctly showing up on your webpage or a background color will not load be sure to make sure all classes/elements are correctly typed in with no typos. You can also check the bottom right hand corner for any troublshooting in the style.css file.
- images
  - If a image fails to load check the image name and make sure it matches the html file where it should be in ther webpage. If it does make sure it is properly sourced.
  - Sometimes a simple refresh is all you need to get it to load in.
  - If you wish to change the text for when a photo does not appear, just change the description inside the quotes of the alt tag for the desired image. (I have added alt tags to all of your images.)

Here is a screenshot of what the home page should look like when opened.
